Smart Cleaner Ultimate is a powerful and safe disk cleanup tool designed to find and remove gigabytes of junk files from your Windows system. It features an intelligent scanning engine, a modern and responsive user interface, and a strong focus on performance and safety.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   üöÄ **Blazing Fast Scans:** Utilizes a multi-threaded architecture to scan multiple locations in parallel, making full use of modern CPUs and SSDs.
*   üß† **Intelligent Application Cache Scanner:** Safely finds junk files *inside* application directories (e.g., Discord, Chrome, Spotify) without incorrectly flagging the entire program folder as junk.
*   üé® **Modern Themed GUI:** A clean and responsive interface built with `sv-ttk`, featuring a toggleable Windows 11-style dark mode. Your theme choice is saved automatically.
*   üéØ **Comprehensive Cleaning:** Targets a wide range of junk:
    *   Application Caches (for hundreds of programs)
    *   Windows System Temp & Prefetch
    *   Recycle Bin
    *   Broken Shortcuts on the Desktop and in the Start Menu
*   üîí **"Kill & Delete" for Locked Files:** If a file is in use, the application identifies the locking process and asks for permission to terminate it, allowing for a more thorough cleaning.
*   üñ±Ô∏è **Advanced UI Controls:** Includes full support for **Shift + Click** to select a range of items and an enhanced right-click context menu for quick actions.
*   üïí **Time-Based Filtering:** Focus your cleaning on files that haven't been touched in over 30 days, 90 days, or a year.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9 or newer
*   Windows 10 or 11

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Luc6i/SmartCleaner.git
    cd smartCleaner
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install humanize winshell pywin32 psutil sv-ttk
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    The script will automatically request administrator privileges to perform a deep system scan.
    ```bash
    python cac4.py
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The power of Smart Cleaner Ultimate comes from its intelligent and safe scanning logic:

*   **Parallel Processing:** The main scan manager uses a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to launch multiple scan tasks at once (Application Caches, System Files, Shortcuts). This drastically reduces the total analysis time.
*   **Safe Application Scanning:** Instead of using a flawed "leftover" detection model, the `scan_application_data` function iterates through top-level application folders in `%APPDATA%` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%`. It then performs a targeted, recursive search *within* these folders for common cache and log directory names. This ensures that only true junk folders are flagged, leaving the core application files untouched.
*   **Safety Blacklist:** A hardcoded blacklist prevents the scanner from ever analyzing critical system folders like `Microsoft` or `Programs`, adding an extra layer of protection against false positives.
